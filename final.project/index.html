<h1>Crossfit (noun):</h1> <h3>a high-intensity fitness program incorporating elements from several sports and types of exercise</h3>
<p><h3><em> "I thought I was strong until I tried to do Crossfit" </em></h3></p>
  <div>When one thinks of Crossfit, a lot of preconceived notions may come to my mind. Well, I'm here to tell you that there's no reason to be initimidated. If you're thinking of joining your local box, or simply are looking for a fun way to get in shape - look no further.</div>


<h1>My Story</h1>
<div>I've always been into fitness, but before Crossfit I was really lost. I would show up to a typical "bro" gym, and do some free weights on my own, with zero guidance on form or programming. Within the first 3 months of Crossfit, I was seeing more muscle gains and progress than I had in the past couple of years. Why work harder when you can just work smarter?</div>

<h1>Before/After</h1>
<div>Right picture was taken after only 1 year of Crossfit</div>
