<h1>Nutrition Fundamentals</h1>
<h3>So, you're working hard and tearing your muscles in the gym...If you want full results, you need to help them repair with all the right macro and micro nutrients.</h3>
<h4><em>Most Crossfitters follow a paleo framework, although it's not necessary to follow this with 100% accuracy. What's important is...</em></h4>
<li>Fueling your body with whole, nutrient dense foods at least 80% of the time</li>
<li>Intaking enough carbs for your activity level (eat majority pre and post workout)</li>
<li>Don't fully deprive yourself of anything, because this will set you up for potential binges down the road</li>

<h2>Fuel Sources</h2>
<ul><b>Meat</b>: GRASS-FED*, not grain-fed. Grain causes the same problem in animals as they do in humans.</ul>
<ul><b>Fowl</b>: Chicken, duck, hen, turkey…things with wings that (try to) fly.</ul>
<ul><b>Fish</b>: Wild fish, as mercury and other toxins can be an issue in farmed fish</ul>
<ul><b>Eggs</b>: Look for omega-3 enriched cage free eggs.</ul>
<ul><b>Vegetables</b>: Unlimited</ul>
<ul><b>Oils</b>: Olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil</ul>
<ul><b>Fruits</b>: Have natural sugar, and can be higher in calories, so limit if you’re trying to lose weight.</ul>
<ul><b>Nuts</b>: High in calories, so they’re good for a snack, but don’t eat bags and bags of them.</ul>
<ul><b>Tubers</b>: Sweet potatoes and yams. Higher in calories and carbs, so these are good for right after a workout to replenish your glycogen levels.</ul>
